## Business Understanding
*__Overview__*
##### SyriaTel is a telecommunication company that specializes in the provision of data and voice services. Like its competitors, the companyâ€™s overarching goal is profit maximization. However, one of the major challenges it faces is customer churn, which occurs when subscribers cancel their services and switch to competitors. This project seeks to address that challenge through data-driven methods

*__The Problem__:* 
##### SyriaTel is losing a significant amount of revenue because many customers are canceling their services. At present, the company does not have a reliable system to predict which customers are most likely to leave. Without such a system, it is difficult to intervene in time to retain customers, which ultimately leads to reduced profits and loss of market share.

**Reasons for data selection**:


**Data Description**


**Outliers**: 
Why we decided to keep outliers:

1. customer behavior naturally varies widely.
2. Heavy users who suddenly reduce usage might be prime churn candidates. These patterns are crucial for retention strategies
3. Customers with extremely high usage are often the most profitable clients and removing them would eliminate key revenue insights
