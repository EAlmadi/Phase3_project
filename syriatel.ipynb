    "## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING  \n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is a telecommunication company that specializes in the provision of data and voice services. Like its competitors, the companyâ€™s overarching goal is profit maximization. However, one of the major challenges it faces is customer churn, which occurs when subscribers cancel their services and switch to competitors. This project seeks to address that challenge through data-driven methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is losing a significant amount of revenue because many customers are canceling their services. At present, the company does not have a reliable system to predict which customers are most likely to leave. Without such a system, it is difficult to intervene in time to retain customers, which ultimately leads to reduced profits and loss of market share.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Business Objective  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main business objective is to reduce customer churn by predicting which customers are at risk of leaving. Achieving this will allow SyriaTel to take timely action and improve customer retention.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Project Objectives  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Objective**  \n",
    "The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classifier that can accurately predict whether a SyriaTel customer is likely to churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives**  \n",
    "The specific objectives of the project are:  \n",
    "1. To analyze customer attributes and usage patterns in order to identify the key drivers of churn.  \n",
    "2. To develop, train, and evaluate predictive models that classify customers as churners or non-churners.  \n",
    "3. To generate actionable business insights and recommendations, based on the model outputs, that can support strategies to reduce customer churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Research Questions  \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is guided by the following research questions:  \n",
    "1. What characteristics are most strongly associated with customers who churn?  \n",
    "2. Which machine learning algorithm provides the best predictive performance for churn classification?  \n",
    "3. How can the insights from the churn model be applied to design effective customer retention strategies?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Success Criteria  \n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be assessed in three ways. First, it should generate actionable insights that SyriaTel can use to reduce churn rates in the future. Second, the predictive model should achieve acceptable levels of performance, with high accuracy and a strong ability to correctly identify customers who are likely to leave. Finally, the results should be presented in a way that is clear and interpretable, so that they can be easily understood and applied by business managers and decision-makers.  \n",
